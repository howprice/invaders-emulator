# TODO

- Migrate this list to GitHub Issues
- Save/Load settings e.g. Display options (See SDL2-Asteroids)
- Figure out SDL2 Mac High DPI. See SDL_CreateWindow docs. Requires Info.plist?
- Deploy with travis?
- Apply coloured overlay (make machine display buffer RGB8 and apply in video RAM copy)
- Watchpoints (break when memory read/written to)
- Move debugHook into debugger class/file
- Get rid of Machine.memorySizeBytes: memory could have gaps, and may not be a contiguous block
- Update memory window to select Chunk to view, which is guaranteed to be a single contiguous block.
- "Backtrace" Window (Previously executed line(s))
- Stack Window
  - Store "stack base" when SP set with LXI SP,<address> instruction
- Editable registers in CPU Window
- Trap?
- Disassembly Window:
  - Use ImGuiListClipper (see ImGui hex editor code)
  - Add Autoscroll option
- Support loading of symbols file
    - Ref: pasmo docs
	- Ref: Computer Archaeology annotated disassembly
- Load different Midway 8080 Black & White compatible ROMs
  - List in mame\src\mame\drivers\mw8080bw.cpp
- Cheats
  - How does MAME handle cheats?
- Accurate display buffer generation by copying pixel by pixel as the CPU / raster progresses. 
- What is the correct point in the frame to generate the interrupts? See machine update function
- Headless mode (command line arg)
- What is the purpose of the RAM mirror? (It *is* used)
